# Odin Project Foundations Course - Landing Page Project

This project from the Odin Project Foundations Course unit on Flexbox requires the recreation of a landing page from a given example with HTML and CSS to instill foundational web development and design skills.

## The landing page must include:
* A header with a Logo and menu/navigation. 
* A hero section with a button and an image. 
* A subsection with 4 images and subtext. 
* A block quote/testimonial section. 
* A call to action section with an additional button. 
* A footer with copyright information. 

The layout and the css styling, like colors and fonts, are already given. Working on foundational HTML and CSS and working through how to recreate the landing page. 

I hope to hone my skills/understanding with both HTML and CSS. I also hope to work on my problem-solving skills and ability to find information using the internet to find solutions when I am unable to figure it out at the moment. I also hope to get more comfortable using the CLI/Terminal and practicing git and making good commits.


## After Thoughts: 

I learned a lot this project. I completed the project over the course of a few days just going section by section.

I struggled the first couple days as I had some time away from the course and also because this was one of the first projects I was starting from scratch on my own. 

I noticed at the begining I felt reasonably comfortable with the basic HTML that was needed for the project. My struggle, and the main emphasis of the project, was when I got to the CSS styling and using flexbox. 

However, now after completing the project I feel much more comfortable with basic CSS styling and much more confident in my understanding of flexbox. I feel quite successful with my project. 

I dont think I perfected the project or think that I am now a master in either HTML or CSS. However, I feel really good about my progress, my ability to push through moments of frustration, and now know what areas that I would like to put some extra research and study into to get better. Which to me is a success. 

I admit I ran into some frustrating moments trying to do things I thought were supposed to work initally but was unable to figure out why they weren't working on my own. 

In this process of learning I have been working on stepping away, especially when frustration comes in to play. Coming back to the project with fresh eyes and revitalized motivation. 

At the end, I decided to revisit some videos on basic CSS and Flexbox that were given through the Odin Project course. I even watched some extra ones. This really helped me review and better understand what I was missing and didn't know or forggotten. 

When I went back into my project I noticed I had a much better understanding of what it was I was doing when implementing flexbox. I even found that drawing out the layout i was trying to accomplish for the section on a notecard, to visually see what contained what, greatly improved my ability to figure it out the code. A strategy I plan to use in the future when I am having trouble. 

I even learned a little basic markdown to help make this README file a bit nicer to look at. 

All of my focus throughout this course and development journey so far has been using HTML and CSS. Now that I am done with this project the next third of the course is dedicated to Javascript which will be my first ever real insight into any programming langauge. I am quite nervous and admittely a bit overwhelmed at the thought of it but I am also very excited.
