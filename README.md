# landing_page_odinproject

This project from the Odin Project Foundations Course unit on Flexbox requires the recreation of a landing page from a given example with HTML and CSS to instill foundational web development and design skills.

The landing page must include 
- A header with a Logo and menu/navigation. 
- A hero section with a button and an image. 
- A subsection with 4 images and subtext. 
- A block quote/testimonial section. 
- A call to action section with an additional button. 
- A footer with copyright information. 

The layout and the css styling, like colors and fonts, are already given. Working on foundational HTML and CSS and working through how to recreate the landing page. 

I hope to hone my skills/understanding with both HTML and CSS. I also hope to work on my problem-solving skills and ability to find information using the internet to find solutions when I am unable to figure it out at the moment. I also hope to get more comfortable using the CLI/Terminal and practicing git and making good commits.
